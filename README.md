# Artemis WindowsTheme Plugin
Provides data bindings for the current Windows system and app theme for [Artemis](https://github.com/Artemis-RGB/Artemis).

This module provides data model variables for the current Windows `SystemTheme` and `AppTheme`. Both of these variables have two states: `Light` or `Dark`.
